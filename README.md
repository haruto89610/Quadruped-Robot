# Quadruped-Robot

An arduino based 12 DOF quadruped robot

This is still an ongoing project so please don't expect it to work perfectly.

So far, I've got the robot to walk and am currently working on making it turn. The rotations should not take too much time as it is just adjusting the hip servos.

I'm hoping that people can help me develop this robot so it moves more smoothly.
